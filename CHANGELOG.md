# preFlight Changelog

## v1.1.0

Note: You didn't read this wrong. With this release, we are jumping straight to v1.1.0 and skipping v1.0.1-stable with some significant changes.

### Themes
- UI theme system with 40+ built-in themes (Auto, Default Light / Dark, plus community favorites including Catppuccin, Matrix, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night, Rose Pine, and many more)
  - Change themes via the drop down in Preferences > GUI

### Sidebar
- Replaced per-row visibility checkboxes with a dedicated Edit Visibility mode and a Tabbed/Accordion view toggle at the bottom of the sidebar
  - Every option in the sidebar has a visibility checkbox - if the sidebar feels cluttered, you can hide anything you don't use
- Added "Legacy layout for Prepare" preference that mirrors the Prepare view horizontally - sidebar moves to the right, gizmo toolbar to the left
- Click the filament color swatch in the Filament dropdown to open the color picker directly

### Intel macOS
- New build available for Intel macOS machines

### Auto Speed
- Added Auto speed checkbox that calculates print move speeds from each filament's max volumetric flow (MVF), capped at an effective max print speed (MPS)
  - Setting individual speeds to 0 still triggers volumetric speed calculation for that feature
- Unified auto speed calculation paths and fixed filament max print speed override behavior - filament_max_print_speed is now an auto speed ceiling override only (MVF remains the unconditional physical safety cap)
- Added filament_max_volumetric_flow as the primary max volumetric flow setting, replacing the legacy filament_max_volumetric_speed (kept as a synced alias)
- Added filament_max_print_speed to override the print profile's max print speed on a per-filament basis

Note: MVF caps all print speeds regardless of whether Auto speed is enabled - if your speeds seem lower than expected, check that the active filament's MVF is set correctly. MPS only applies to Auto speed and does not affect manually set speeds.

### Klipper
- Added native Klipper machine limits for accurate time estimation - max_velocity, max_accel, square_corner_velocity, and minimum_cruise_ratio fields matching printer.cfg (#183)
- Time estimator handles SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT G-code commands for mid-print parameter changes
- Fixed minimum_cruise_ratio time estimation - ported Klipper's two-pass LookAheadQueue flush for accurate junction-dense geometry estimates

### GPU / Rendering
- Active GPU renderer now displayed in the title bar for easy identification and support
- Improved GPU detection - removed Intel GPU blocklist that forced basic lighting on capable cards like Arc A770
- Enabled Enhanced (Blinn-Phong) lighting on all hardware GPUs passing the OpenGL 3.2 minimum
- Lighting quality changes in Preferences now take effect without restart via deferred shader compilation

### Athena Perimeter Generation
- Perimeter compression no longer allows "Disabled" - minimal bead compression is required to prevent unfilled gaps
  - The new floor is "Minimal" (75%), and legacy profiles migrate automatically (#195)
- Promoted FillEnsuring gap fill from Arachne to Athena, eliminating oscillating-width diamond artifacts on staircase-shaped gap boundaries
- Fixed unnecessary infill in thin regions by subtracting actual innermost bead coverage from the inner contour
- Routed narrow-to-Athena fills to concentric instead of Ensuring, preventing bridge anchor geometry erosion from grouping collision

### Thumbnails
- Replaced the fragile thumbnails text field with a structured editor dialog with per-row size and format controls
- Added COLPIC (Elegoo/Chitu) and BTT_TFT (BigTreeTech) G-code thumbnail formats
- Unknown thumbnail formats are now a non-blocking warning instead of a hard error
- Platter renders in the theme accent so thumbnails match the active theme

### Orca Import
- Orca G-code variables now resolve at runtime via alias mapping to their preFlight equivalents - works in both `[bracket]` and `{brace}` syntax
- Commented-out G-code lines (starting with `;`) are no longer evaluated, preventing parse errors from leftover Orca placeholders
- Import results dialog now clearly labels skipped settings as "Orca-Exclusive" with an explanation

### G-code Variables
- Local variables (`{local ...}`) can now shadow config keys, allowing overrides like `{local retract_lift = 0.5}`
- Unified resolution order (locals > config > aliases) across both `[bracket]` and `{brace}` syntax

### Cooling
- Fixed fan always on not acting as a floor against dynamic overhang fan speed overrides
  - M107 no longer fires on supported extrusions when keep fan always on is set
- Fixed fan ramp backward insertion crossing fan-off commands, causing emitted fan speed to desync for the rest of the layer (#164)
- Fixed reset fan speed firing during manual fan mode, overriding per-feature speeds
- UI now disables fan_always_on when manual fan controls are active

### Localization
- Brought all 20 language catalogs to 100% translated (0 untranslated, 0 fuzzy) with a cross-language semantic review

### UI
- Added configurable extrusion width warning thresholds per nozzle (33-500%), replacing hardcoded 60%/150% warning limits (#146)
- Enabled right-click context menu in WebView printer UIs
- Widened seam line snap threshold from 5 to 15 degrees for more reliable activation on curved surfaces
- Rewrote interlocking overlap tooltip and added tuning guidance note
- Removed obsolete "Sequential slider applied only to top layer" preference - the behavior is now always on

## v1.0.1-beta1

### Orca Import
Cross-product profile importing is rare for good reason - every slicer has exclusive settings that simply don't exist elsewhere. OrcaSlicer has over 140 of them. preFlight reports these transparently so you know exactly what mapped and what didn't. In this release, we more clearly call that out. We also tackled slicing errors caused by Orca G-code variables in Custom G-code fields by natively mapping them to their preFlight equivalents.

- Orca G-code variables now resolve at runtime via alias mapping to their preFlight equivalents - works in both `[bracket]` and `{brace}` syntax
- Commented-out G-code lines (starting with `;`) are no longer evaluated, preventing parse errors from leftover Orca placeholders
- Import results dialog now clearly labels skipped settings as "Orca-Exclusive" with an explanation

### G-code Variables
- Local variables (`{local ...}`) can now shadow config keys, allowing overrides like `{local retract_lift = 0.5}`
- Unified resolution order (locals > config > aliases) across both `[bracket]` and `{brace}` syntax

### Cooling
- Fixed fan ramp backward insertion crossing fan-off commands, causing emitted fan speed to desync from firmware state for the rest of the layer (#164)
- Fixed reset fan speed firing during manual fan mode, overriding per-feature speeds
- UI now disables fan_always_on when manual fan controls are active

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed null dereference crash when printer webview authentication completed after the panel was destroyed (#159)
- Printer webview tab now reuses the existing tab instead of opening duplicates (#159)
- Fixed binary G-code (bGcode) export producing plain text output regardless of the binary_gcode setting (#165)

## Promotion to v1.0.0!

It's a red letter day! A small release of fixes with big implications. Yes, there are still bugs, our roadmap is a mile long, and we're just getting started, but at some point you have to rip off band-aid and ship it - this is that moment. Welcome to preFlight v1.0.0!

### Athena Perimeter Generation
- Added Max Perimeter Width setting (% of nozzle, default 150%) to control how much beads can expand to fill gaps - thin walls exceeding this limit split into a two-bead loop sized using the external/perimeter overlap setting
- Fixed bead width mismatch between perimeters=1 and perimeters=2 for identical geometry - the 0-width infill boundary marker was incorrectly handled during odd-case bead adjustment
- Fixed single-bead wall overlap at thin-wall-to-body junctions where beads grew past external width before splitting, causing heavy overlap at U-turns
- Fixed two-external thin wall contraction so both beads use external perimeter width and contract proportionally to maintain the configured overlap ratio

### Performance
- Painted snug/grid supports generation time significantly reduced via parallel processing that precomputes downward projection through sparse change points

### G-code Preview
- Fixed segments disappearing at viewport center when camera view direction was exactly perpendicular to a segment's axis

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed crash when navigating away from Output options page due to dangling pointer after page hierarchy destruction

## v0.9.15

### Performance
- Slicing has been optimized resulting in 2.5x faster processing
  - Replaced Voronoi medial axis with offset-based erosion for narrow surface detection
  - Parallelized 5 serialized loops in bridge_over_infill
  - Simplified Voronoi skeleton inner contours to reduce downstream Clipper2 cost
- Implemented GCodeObject - a unified data model carrying G-code and structured move data through the entire pipeline
- Enabled streaming move processing during G-code generation, eliminating a redundant full re-parse of all G-code
- Added Preview Detail setting in Preferences > Performance to control preview fidelity vs. slicing speed (1M/5M/10M/20M segments or Full)
  - Actual Speed preview coloring shows less detail on prints exceeding the threshold
  - Defaults to 10M on desktop, 1M on ARM Linux (Raspberry Pi)

### Export to Script
- Added Export to Script - a new export pathway that hands G-code data to a user-configured Python script for output handling (save to disk, upload via FTP, send to networked printers, or all at once)
- Script receives gcode.data (mutable list of G-code lines) and gcode.filename (from Output filename format) - no proprietary APIs, just standard Python
- Export to Script appears in the export dropdown alongside Save locally and Send to Printer when enabled
- 3MF files containing script references prompt the user on load and strip settings if declined
- Consent dialog updated to cover both Preprocessing and Export to Script under a single security prompt
- Included sample scripts: save_to_folder.py, ftps_upload.py (implicit TLS, port 990), save_and_upload.py (multi-output)
- Included type stubs and HOW_TO_USE documentation in resources/export

### Per-Filament Pressure Advance
- Added per-filament pressure advance settings with an enable toggle and configurable PA value - emits firmware-appropriate commands after start filament G-code on every tool/filament change
- Added validation warning when PA enablement is inconsistent across filaments used within a print

### Extrusion Widths
- Added option to choose if extrusion widths expressed as percentages are calculated from layer height or nozzle diameter

### Gap Fill
- Enabled Athena variable-width gap-fill for single-perimeter walls

### Infill / Fill
- Fixed bottom_fill_pattern ignored when support material was enabled and top contact distance was set to "No gap"

### Filament UI
- Consolidated Filament / Filament Properties into a main Properties group
- Expanded filament type dropdown from 20 to 45 types sourced from our profiles repo, sorted alphabetically

### Preprocessor Scripts
- Added jerk_by_feature.py sample script for per-feature jerk/junction deviation control (RepRapFirmware, Klipper, Marlin)

### Profiles
- Added local vendor profile import to Configuration Wizard - users can load vendor profile bundles from ZIP files with path traversal protection and security hardening

## v0.9.14

### G-code Preprocessing (Python Scripting) with 150 APIs and all settings
- Added embedded Python pre-processor for G-code scripting - users can run Python scripts against sliced G-code before preview and export with full read/write access to moves, layers, settings, and raw G-code lines
- Pre-processing runs inside the slicing pipeline giving unprecedented access never before achieved
- Bundled Python 3.14.4 runtime so end users don't need Python installed - fully isolated with no system directories, PATH, or registry modified
- Added per-profile preprocessing UI with consent-gated script execution - each settings panel (Print, Filament, Printer) gets a Preprocessing tab with an enable toggle and ordered script list
- Exposed motion planner data to scripts: distance, junction angle, acceleration, max entry speed, per-role metrics, and conflict detection
- Exposed per-fill-region geometry to scripts: region area (mm^2) and fill pattern name for detecting small features
- Added state isolation per slice: snapshots and restores sys.path, sys.modules, signal handlers, and CWD before/after each script
- Added pip support with a Python Console button in Preferences that launches a shell with PATH configured for the bundled runtime
- Added per-move annotations and optional comment parameters for insert, rewrite, prepend, and append operations
- Added error reporting: script errors, missing scripts, and cross-profile duplicates surface as breadcrumb notifications
- Added script validation: rejects invalid Python identifiers on add, blocks duplicate paths within the same profile, deduplicates across profiles at slice time
- Included 18 sample scripts (numpy, pressure advance, flow limiting, fan curves, motion optimizer, and more) with comprehensive API test
- Included preFlight.py type stub for autocomplete and intellisense in external editors
- Included comprehensive HOW TO document located in resources/preprocessor

### Profiles / Configuration Wizard
- Added ProfileServer client that fetches vendor profiles from profiles.preflight3d.com
- Rewrote Configuration Wizard: Choose Vendors page with saved selections, alphabetically sorted vendor printer pages, Type/Vendor toggle on filaments page
- Wizard saves printer, print, and filament presets as user .ini files with overwrite prompts and save-failure reporting
- Flattened preset combo boxes (removed system/user/template separators)
- Removed Compare preset button (no system reference to compare against)
- Filament page starts clean (no pre-selected profiles), defaults to Vendor > Type sort
- Added community-sourced disclaimer with link to profiles repository on filament page
- Added path traversal protection and HTTP status validation on profile downloads

### Rendering / Lighting
- Added Blinn-Phong per-pixel lighting with specular highlights and rim lighting as an "Enhanced" alternative to Gouraud shading - GPU auto-detection selects the appropriate mode
- Added user-configurable MSAA anti-aliasing dropdown (Auto/Off/2x/4x/8x/16x) in Preferences > Performance
- Added spherical harmonics studio-environment reflections to the Phong shader for subtle surface sheen
- Upgraded MMU painting gizmo shaders to Blinn-Phong with specular and rim lighting to match the 3D editor's lighting quality
- Fixed painting gizmos (seam, support, fuzzy skin, counterbore) invisible when Enhanced lighting was active due to shader mismatch causing depth buffer rejection

### UI Migration Prepwork
- Abstracted the entire rendering pipeline (GLCanvas3D, Selection, GCodeViewer, 3DScene, all 21 gizmos)
- Extracted stb_truetype from imgui into standalone bundled dependency
- Added engine boundary firewall preventing wx/imgui in libslic3r at configure time
- Routed all GL surface operations through toolkit-agnostic IGLSurface interface and replaced wxTimer-based timers with callback-driven ITimer interface
- Converted all event posts, mouse/keyboard input, and gizmo handlers to toolkit-agnostic types

### Interlocking Perimeters
- Added "Perimeters while interlocking" setting to reduce wall count on interlocking layers while retaining interlocking strength (issue #122)
- Stabilized interlocking inner contour across even/odd layers - phase 1 now uses consistent parameters so Athena's skeleton produces stable results regardless of layer parity
- Fixed interlocking shell ordering: replaced centroid-to-centroid distance matching with minimum point-to-point distance, sorted by inset index instead of shortest-path chaining
- Fixed interlocking shells clipped at narrow visibility zone boundary strips by applying morphological opening to the visibility zone
- Fixed solid infill overlapping perimeters on multi-hole thin shells after interlocking consumed interior space

### Infill / Fill
- Absorbed thin sparse slivers into adjacent bridge and solid fills - extended the solid absorption loop to also use bridge fills as absorbers with an effective gap test
- Fixed rectilinear/monotonic solid infill overlapping perimeters at interior cutouts by stretching holes directionally in the scan direction before fill generation
- Limited solid infill hole-stretch overlap fix to internal solid only - top and bottom surfaces retain full coverage at hole boundaries for surface quality
- Fixed solid infill producing empty regions on polygons with holes near contour edge by falling back to monotonic code path on malformed intersection data
- Fixed sparse infill (Grid, Triangles, Stars, Cubic) missing segments near holes due to misplaced tangent-line clipping intended for solid fills
- Fixed greedy chain walk silently dropping polylines causing large empty regions in Line sparse infill when segment clusters were disconnected
- Fixed counterbore bridge infill not merging with adjacent internal bridge due to angle-based grouping separating overlapping corridor regions

### Athena Perimeter Generation
- Fixed diamond artifacts on variable-width walls by blocking center bead splits when resulting beads would be too narrow
- Fixed thin-ring infill overlap where Clipper operations lost contour/hole winding on thin annular rings, turning a thin ring into a full disc covering perimeters

### Seams
- Fixed nip/tuck seam double-notch on thin walls where two external perimeters shared a single inner perimeter

### 3MF Import
- Fixed crash when importing config from PrusaSlicer 3MF projects (issue #125)

### G-code Preview
- Fixed G-code viewer losing base moves during incremental actual speed insertion, causing missing segment tips and wrong actual speed coloring

### Supports
- Fixed organic supports not generating inside closed perimeters due to Clipper2 migration breaking polygon winding preservation (issue #123)
- Fixed enforce-layers generating blanket support for all overhangs in paint-on mode instead of limiting to painted areas
- Fixed support crash on non-ExtrusionPath entities (ExtrusionMultiPath, ExtrusionLoop, ExtrusionEntityCollection)


## v0.9.13

### Reissue of v0.9.12 due to regression issue
- v0.9.12 introduced an Athena regression that dropped infill on geometry where the marker pass produced fragmented (open) output. The defensive PolylineStitcher guard prevented loose stitching that was accidentally compensating for that marker fragility. v0.9.13 reverts the defensive guard.

### CMYK Color Mixing - Preview
- Added CMYK color mixing gizmo for painting multi-ratio blends across a model using a per-filament palette - replaces the MMU segmentation gizmo in the toolbar while legacy MMU painted 3MFs still load and slice correctly
- Built the color prediction on Beer-Lambert transmission physics with a per-filament Transmission Distance (TD), so the preview adapts to the actual translucency of the user's spool instead of a fixed pigment-blend approximation
- Added target-color-driven palette solving - enter a hex color and the optimizer searches pairwise and single-filament candidates across all ratios, scoring each against the target with CIEDE2000 delta-E rather than making the user guess a ratio and eyeball the result
- Auto-generated palettes now include up to 512 entries (pure filaments, pairwise blends, tints, shades, chromatic+black darks, chromatic+white lights, and triples) so a single scan finds a match for every painted region across a complex model
- Extended the TriangleSelector to 16-bit state (up to 65,535 recipes per volume, 256x the upstream 8-bit limit) so complex models never run out of paintable palette slots
- Added TD1S sensor integration that closes the calibration loop end-to-end - measure the spool, write TD into the preset, and both preview rendering and slicer pattern-solving consume the measured value
- Added filament_transmission_distance to filament settings for accurate color prediction, with TD-aware convergence that scales simulation depth to the palette's max TD
- Added Alt+click eyedropper in the gizmo to pick the painted state under the cursor into the active brush slot
- Added color_mixing_base_layers and color_mixing_base_extruder to lock the bottom N layers to a single filament for a uniform bottom face
- Palette IDs are stable and cached via FNV-1a key over (colors, TDs, layer height); painted intent survives filament swaps because find_best_match re-resolves state against the runtime palette instead of being locked to physical extruder indices
- Collapsed extruder_colour into filament_colour as the single source of truth across sidebar, 3D view, G-code preview, and stored G-code extruder_colors
- Serialized color_mixing_facets and color_mixing_palette through ModelVolume save/load so undo/redo and 3MF round-trip preserve painted state

### Preferences (CPU / GPU Stability)
- Added Maximum slicing threads preference to cap TBB parallelism on unstable CPUs
- Added Prefer Performance cores preference that restricts the process to P-cores on Intel hybrid CPUs (Windows and Linux x64)
- Added Disable NVIDIA OpenGL Threaded Optimization toggle that writes a per-app driver profile via NVAPI - shown only when an NVIDIA driver is present, with inline manual instructions as a fallback

### Athena Perimeter Generation
- Fixed Athena emitting 0-width contour markers as real extrusions that appeared as long straight lines across empty space - LimitedBeadingStrategy marker junctions are now classified per line so pure markers feed only the inner contour
- Fixed Athena emitting tiny visible specks on top of existing perimeters when an even-paired wall couldn't close into a loop (orphan fragments smaller than their own bead width are now dropped).

### Brim / Mouse Ears
- Rewrote inner brim generation to compute width-bounded rings around all solid boundaries inside holes, filled with concentric Athena loops and quantized to whole beads to eliminate compressed extra loops
- Fixed an infinite loop in inner brim where the NORMAL group's brim_width was never set
- Rewrote painted mouse ear clipping to offset all solid boundaries by the overlap amount and diff from the ear circle in one operation, handling outer contours and inner holes uniformly
- Fixed painted mouse ears bypassing no_brim_area so per-ear overlap settings are preserved
- Preserved concentric brim adhesion order so each loop sticks to the previous one instead of being reordered by entity chaining

### Cooling
- Added "Don't slow down outer walls" per-filament setting that exempts external perimeters from the cooling buffer's minimum-layer-time slowdown, preventing wall thickness taper on thin-walled parts - imports directly from OrcaSlicer profiles

### G-code
- Fixed over-bridge speed bypassing filament_max_volumetric_speed - the override was injected after cap_speed() had been applied, allowing solid infill above bridges to exceed the volumetric limit

## v0.9.12

### Bug Fixes / Improvements
- Fixed solid infill gaps between fill and innermost perimeters on bottom/top solid layers caused by progressive edge erosion during horizontal shell propagation
- Fixed solid infill overflowing into object through-holes when hole removal failed to recognize real object features vs trimming artifacts
- Fixed excessive solid infill consuming entire sparse regions on small objects at low infill densities - reduced absorption threshold from 16x to 4x line spacing squared
- Added erosion test to solid hole removal so thin projected features from geometry above are filled solid instead of left as unfillable sparse gaps
- Fixed large top/bottom surfaces being falsely classified as narrow, causing them to be skipped or have their fill pattern overridden
- Fixed greedy polyline chaining silently dropping disconnected segment clusters, which caused missing infill on some layers with Adaptive Cubic

## v0.9.8

### Interlocking Perimeters
- Replaced polygon-offset shell generation with Athena's skeletal trapezoidation engine for interlocking perimeters - naturally handles narrow channels and bead count transitions
- Redesigned interlocking bead geometry to use three flow-scaled tiers (100%, ~146%, 200%) - the ~146% boundary bead width is derived so outer edges align with the 100% boundary bead on alternate layers to keep inter-shell gaps uniform
- Replaced flow-rate overlap with geometric centerline spacing modification - overlap bonding now works the same way as perimeter-to-perimeter overlap, eliminating over-extrusion at shell boundaries

### Alternating Nip/Tuck Seams
- Added Alt. Nip/Tuck seam type - alternates between Nip on even layers and Tuck on odd layers to distribute seam disturbance across both sides of the junction

### Orca Import
- Added warning dialog before OrcaSlicer profile import informing users that imported profiles will need careful review due to differences between applications

### Print Host
- Fixed RRF standalone machine limits race condition where stale rr_reply queue entries caused values to be incorrectly applied to the wrong fields in stand-alone mode

### Preview/Legend
- Modified fan speed legend to always show 10 fixed bands (0-10%, 11-20%, ..., 91-100%) regardless of data distribution
- Capped all range-based legends to 10 bands maximum - values exceeding 10 distinct groups are merged via frequency-weighted quantiles

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed slicing animation not switching to Preview tab during slice
- Fixed accidental object deletion in Preview when pressing Delete/Backspace - objects are now deselected when slicing begins

- Fixed SOB/InternalSolid merge to use geometric adjacency instead of layer-wide thin heuristic, and corrected tiny-SOB removal threshold from sparse density to solid fill spacing
- Skipped bridge-over-infill for single-layer sparse gaps - prevented monotonic bridge pattern on isolated layers sandwiched between normal infill
- Optimized concentric fill: cluster spatially adjacent loops, rotate to nearest vertex

### G-code
- Eliminated redundant standalone `G1 F` lines
- Fixed manual fan controls producing no M106 for non-bridge features
