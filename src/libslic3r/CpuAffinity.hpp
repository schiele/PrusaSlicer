// CPU affinity helpers for working around multithreading instability on unstable or hybrid-topology CPUs
// (most commonly Intel 12th gen+ with P/E cores, or degraded Raptor Lake silicon).
// Implemented on Windows x86/x64 and Linux x86/x64. macOS and ARM builds get no-op stubs: the P/E core
// concept here is Intel hybrid specific, and macOS does not expose per-process P/E affinity by design.

// or if we are not on Windows. Saves the previous affinity mask the first time it succeeds so
